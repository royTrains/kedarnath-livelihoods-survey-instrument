# the instrument, because it was previously duplicated: build_scripts.py held the full version and
# build_webform.py a shorter paraphrase of it, and NEITHER reached the tablet — the consent question's
# own text said "Read the consent script" while the script itself appeared only in the printed script.
# An enumerator holding a phone had nothing to read. Informed consent is the one thing in this
# instrument that cannot be left to memory, so it is now rendered on the consent screen itself.

If you say no, I will not ask you any questions. I will write down only that you said no, the date and time, and what was happening at the time, such as crowding or weather. I will not write down your name, your sex, your age, or where you are. No answers are recorded."""

# as the enumerator not having listened. Each one says what is about to be asked, how long it runs,

    # the respondents who prepare longest, which is the owners rather than the day workers. They are

# Presentation order, NOT variable order. status_m1 is still January and every downstream month
# calculation is unchanged — what moves is the sequence the enumerator is walked through. The
# calendar used to open on January and then instruct "fill the Yatra months first, then the others",
# which is an instruction the form cannot obey: it shows one question per screen in dictionary order.
# Opening at the season instead makes the instruction unnecessary, because the order IS the
# instruction, and it starts recall at the months the respondent remembers best. May is the opening:
# the Yatra runs from Akshaya Tritiya to Bhai Dooj, so late April or May through November.
# The twelve-month activity calendar and the twelve monthly earnings questions were both cut on
# 2026-10-05. Twenty-four questions, and the first field test showed why they could not stand: of
# seven real interviews, three took the annual-total route rather than answer month by month, and
# one of the four who tried the calendar filled four cells of twelve -- with values of 1, 1, 100 and
# 10,000 rupees. A calendar answered a third of the way is worse than an annual total, because
# yatra_income is then summed over whichever cells happened to be filled.
#
# What replaces them is three questions for the calendar and one for earnings. Nothing that the
# downstream construction needs is lost: yatra_months, months_no_work, offseason_months_worked and
# offseason_primary were each a single count or mode over the twelve cells, and are now asked
# directly. See REBUILD_2026-10-05.md for income_seasonality_cv, which survives because its

# ---- food security: FIES, replacing the ten rCSI day-counts (2026-10-05) -----------------------
# The rCSI block was five WFP items asked twice, once per season, as 0-7 day counts. It went to the
# field on 2026-10-05 and did not survive it. Of seven real interviews: three answered all ten items
# zero, one answered every one of the ten with exactly 2 (straight-lining), one gave a directionally
# incoherent pattern (more meal-skipping IN the earning season than out of it), and the only
# respondent to cross the rCSI > 20 cutoff was the one interview that is visibly fabricated -- nine
# minutes long, GPS 200 km off-route on a 50 km accuracy fix. Two of seven carried any signal.
#
# The response format was the fault. WFP's item is a census of a week that actually happened ("in
# the past 7 days, how many days did your household..."); ours asked for an integer out of 7 about a
# NORMAL week, which is not a week that happened, so the respondent has to average six months in his
# head and the enumerator ends up converting "when there is no money" into a number. Worse, the word
# "normal" inverts the construct: the rCSI measures coping, meaning departure from the household's
# own baseline, and a household whose baseline IS cheaper food every day answers 7 and is scored as
# being in crisis. On top of that, the stems said "your household" on both limbs while the household
# is 500 km away during the season -- the reference-unit problem Module E was reworded to fix and
# this block never was. And the > 20 threshold was Lyons et al.'s, set on Lebanese refugee
# households answering the original 7-day form; it was never calibrated on anything we were asking.
#
# FIES instead: the behavioural tail of the Food Insecurity Experience Scale, SDG indicator 2.1.2,
# validated across 150+ countries and in use in India. Eight items in full; the five here are the
# severe end, dropping the three ("worried", "unable to eat healthy food", "ate only a few kinds of
# foods") that are experiential rather than behavioural. Why it fits this instrument where the rCSI
# did not: every item is yes/no, so it respects the standing rule against frequency and rating
# scales; the reference period is the last 12 months, so it reaches the lean season while the
# interview happens in the earning season, and the season doubling disappears with it; and the items
# are personally referenced, which a split migrant can answer for himself without speaking for a
# household elsewhere. Ten day-counts become five binaries.

# ---- NITI Nutrition: the one indicator this instrument cannot collect, and the substitute ----
# NITI defines Nutrition (weight 1/6) on ANTHROPOMETRY — measured height, weight and BMI for
# children 0-59 months, women 15-49 and men 15-54. A read-aloud interview at a roadside worksite
# cannot produce that, and no proxy makes it the National MPI's indicator. Two scores are therefore
# built and BOTH are reported:
#   mpi_score        the strict version. Eleven of twelve indicators, Nutrition absent, its 1/6
#                    redistributed proportionally over the eleven. Conservative and transparent:
#                    it claims nothing about nutrition at all.
#   mpi_score_lyons  the substituted version. The food-coping indicator takes Nutrition's 1/6
#                    slot, so all twelve weights are filled and no reweighting happens. This is a
#                    SUBSTITUTION, not a measurement of undernourishment: rCSI measures what the
#                    household did because food or money for food ran short, which is the
#                    food-insecurity route INTO undernutrition rather than undernutrition itself.
#                    It is the indicator Lyons et al. (2023) use for the same dimension in a
#                    survey that likewise could not weigh anybody, at the same cutoff.
# The difference between the two scores is the sensitivity of the headcount to that substitution,
# and it belongs in the robustness table.
